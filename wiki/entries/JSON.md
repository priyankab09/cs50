# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. *It is easy for humans to read and write*. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

JSON is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, [Python](/wiki/Python), and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
